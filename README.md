> # Description 

This project is the landing page of a company, Open Enterprises. It was built based on the design made by [Javier Alaves](https://www.figma.com/@javi) and available [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/839442424194047238).

I built the responsive landing page with React Js and styled it with Tailwind CSS. I created the routes to the other pages with react-router-dom. The landing page also contains some functionalities. For example, the tasks section displays more or fewer task cards with a click. The applicants' section also shows the chosen applicant card with one click.
