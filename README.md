> # Description 

This project is the landing page of a company, Open Enterprises. It was built based on the design made by [Javier Alaves](https://www.figma.com/@javi) and available [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/839442424194047238).
I styled the landing page with Tailwind CSS and built it with React Js. Also, Tailwind CSS helped with the responsiveness of the website.   
I created the routes to the other pages with react-router-dom. The landing page also contains some functionalities. For example, the tasks section displays more or fewer task cards with a click. The applicants' section also shows the chosen applicant card with one click.
